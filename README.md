# Biopoint reproducibility repository

# Installation

Install SEM2 as described here: https://github.com/Synthetic-Physiology-Lab/sem2.git

We used Ovito Pro for visualization: https://www.ovito.org/

All required Python packages are summarized in the `requirements.txt` file.

# Scripts

&#128308; Link all folders to the respective Figure (manuscript should be mature enough by now)

* `multi_particle_nucleus`: Phase-separation of nuclear particles.
  
  &#128308; TODO: explain the folder structure, clean up files that are not needed (mp4s, lammps output, RDF output etc)
* `indentation`:
  
  &#128308; What is the folder here good for? Clean up output that is not needed
* `uq`:
  
  &#128308; add documentation how to run the scripts (which order). The script was wrong, please make sure that the results in the paper are correct (polynomial order 2 but 4 in the paper)
* `optimization`:
  
  &#128308; Explain scripts (which order to run), add reference to Hobson paper here in README 
* `patterns`:
  
   &#128308; Explain scripts.
* `spreading`:
  
   &#128308; Explain scripts. I could run the code out of the box but here actually another version of LAMMPS-SEM should be used, right? I.e., the migration version instead of the proliferation version
